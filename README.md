# Message Analyzer
Welcome to Message Analyzer! This is my portfolio project for Codecademy's "Apply Natural Language Processing with Python" course, which analyzes your text messages! It is trained with thousands of preprocessed text messages sent from all around the world, retrieved from a public dataset. It offers the user an option to read a test dataset (which would have his/her text messages) as well as an interactive command-line menu to see some statistics on these messages and even talk into the microphone to see how positive/negative their message is.

I had a blast working on this project! I cant wait to do more data science/machine learning projects in the future!
